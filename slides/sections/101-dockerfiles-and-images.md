# Dockerfiles and Docker Images

You package your own Windows apps as Docker images, using a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). 

The Dockerfile syntax is straightforward. In this section you'll walk through two Dockerfiles which package websites to run in Windows Docker containers. 

---

## ASP.NET apps in Docker

Have a look at the [Dockerfile for this app](https://github.com/sixeyed/docker-windows-workshop/blob/master/docker/101-dockerfiles-and-images/hostname-app/Dockerfile). It builds a simple ASP.NET website that displays the host name of the server. There are only two instructions:

- [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) specifes the image to use as the starting point for this image
- [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) copies a file from the host into the image, at a known location.

The Dockerfile copies a simple `.aspx` file into the content directory for the default IIS website. 

---

## Build a simple website image

You package an app by building a Docker image from a Dockerfile.

_ Switch to the directory and build the Dockerfile: _

```
cd "$env:workshop\docker\101-dockerfiles-and-images\hostname-app"

docker image build --tag hostname-app .
```

> The output shows Docker executing each instruction in the Dockerfile, and tagging the final image.

---

## Run the new app

Now you can run a container from your image to run the app.

_ Run a detached container with the HTTP port published:_

```
docker container run --detach --publish 80:80 `
  --name app hostname-app
```

> Any traffic coming into the server on port 80 will be managed by Docker and processed by the container.

---

## Browse to the app

When you're connected to the host, to browse the website you can use the local (virtual) IP address of the container.

_Get the container IP address and browse to it: _

```
$ip = docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}' app

firefox "http://$ip"
```

---

## Run multiple instances of the app

Let's see how lightweight the containerized application is. 

_ Run five containers from the same image:_

```
for ($i=0; $i -lt 5; $i++) {
  & docker container run --detach --publish-all --name "app-$i" hostname-app
}
```

> The `publish-all` flag publishes the container ports to random ports on the host. 

---

## Check all the containers

You now have multiple instances of the app running. The Docker image is the same, but each instance will show its own container ID.

_ Browse to all the new containers:_

```
for ($i=0; $i -lt 5; $i++) {
  $ip = & docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}' "app-$i"
  firefox "http://$ip"
}
```

> You'll see that each site displays a different hostname, which is the container ID Docker generates. 

---

## See how much compute the containers use

On the host you have six `w3wp` processes running, which are the IIS worker processes for each container.  

_ Check the the memory and CPU usage for the apps: _

```
Get-Process -Name w3wp | select Id, Name, WorkingSet, Cpu
```

> The worker processes usually average around 40MB of RAM and <1 second of CPU time.

---

## Some issues to fix...

This is a simple ASP.NET website running in Docker, with just two lines in a Dockerfile. But there are two issues we need to fix:

- It took a few seconds for the site to load on first use
- We're not getting any IIS logs from the container

> The cold-start issue is because the IIS service doesn't start a worker process until the first HTTP request comes in.

---

## Logs inside containers

IIS stores request logs in the container filesystem, but Docker is only listening for logs on the standard output from the startup program.

_ Check the logs from one of the app containers: _    

```
docker container logs app-0
```

> The logs are locked inside the container filesystem, Docker doesn't know about them.

---

## Build and run a more complex web app

The next [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sixeyed/docker-windows-workshop/blob/master/docker/101-dockerfiles-and-images/tweet-app/Dockerfile) fixes those issues. These are the main features:

- it configures IIS to write all log output to a single file
- it copies a [startup script](https://github.com/sixeyed/docker-windows-workshop/blob/master/docker/101-dockerfiles-and-images/tweet-app/start.ps1) and [HTML page](https://github.com/sixeyed/docker-windows-workshop/blob/master/docker/101-dockerfiles-and-images/tweet-app/index.html) into the image
- the startup script relays all the IIS log file entries to the console
- it adds a [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) which Docker will use to see if the app is healthy

---

## Build the Tweet app

Build an image from this new Dockerfile.

```
cd "$env:workshop\docker\101-dockerfiles-and-images\tweet-app"

docker image build --tag tweet-app .
```

---

## Run the new app

This is a static HTML site, but you run it in a container in the same way as the last app:

```
docker container run --detach --publish 8080:80 `
  --name tweet-app tweet-app
```

---

## Browse to the new app

You can reach the site by browsing to your computer externally on port 8080, on on the computer by using the container IP address.

_ Find the container IP address and browse to it:_

```
$ip = docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}' tweet-app

firefox "http://$ip"
```

## Now you have your own Docker images

You've built your own images from Dockerfiles. Right now they only live on the computer where you ran the `docker image build` command.

Next you'll see how to share those images by pushing them to Docker Hub, so anyone can run your apps in containers.
